# Nutrition Agent â€“ AI & Cloud-Based Recommendation System

Project Overview:
The Nutrition Agent is an AI-powered system developed using IBM Cloud and WatsonX Runtime to provide real-time nutritional recommendations.
It analyzes user inputs (age, weight, health goals, dietary preferences) and predicts optimal nutrition plans.
This project was built as part of the AICTE & IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on Emerging Technologies (AI & Cloud).

------------------------------
Features:
- AI-Based Nutrition Recommendations: Generates personalized diet plans.
- Cloud-Enabled System: Deployed using IBM Cloud Object Storage and WatsonX Runtime.
- Real-Time Data Integration: Web scraping from Google, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and weather sources.
- Interactive Interface: Provides output via terminal or web-based interface.
- Scalable Architecture: Easily expandable for advanced features.

------------------------------
System Approach:
1. Data Collection:
   - Scraped data from Google, DuckDuckGo, and Wikipedia.
   - Weather data to adapt diet recommendations (e.g., hydration advice in hot climates).
   - User inputs: age, weight, goals, dietary preferences.

2. Data Storage:
   - IBM Cloud Object Storage used for saving datasets and outputs.

3. Model Building:
   - Prompt-based AI using WatsonX Runtime for nutrition recommendations.

4. Deployment:
   - Hosted on IBM Cloud, accessible via command line or web interface.

5. Evaluation:
   - Compared generated diets with standard nutrition guidelines and user feedback.

------------------------------
Algorithm:
- Algorithm Selection:
  Prompt-based AI model using WatsonX for generating meal plans, chosen for its adaptability to dynamic and real-time data.

- Data Input:
  User parameters (age, weight, goals), weather conditions, and web-scraped nutritional databases.

- Training Process:
  Pre-trained models enhanced through prompt-tuning with hyperparameter adjustments to improve response quality.

- Prediction Process:
  Generates real-time recommendations based on user input and adjusts results with contextual data like weather and goals.

------------------------------
Results:
The model provided accurate and relevant nutrition recommendations.

Example:
User Input: Age: 25, Weight: 70kg, Goal: Muscle Gain
Nutrition Agent Output:
- Breakfast: Oats with milk and nuts
- Lunch: Grilled chicken, brown rice, and vegetables
- Dinner: Paneer with quinoa and salad

------------------------------
Conclusion:
The Nutrition Agent effectively delivers personalized diet plans using AI and Cloud technologies.

Challenges faced:
- Data integration from multiple sources
- Prompt optimization for better responses

Future Scope:
- Integration with fitness trackers for automated inputs
- Support for regional diets and multilingual recommendations
- Expansion into a mobile app for real-time accessibility
